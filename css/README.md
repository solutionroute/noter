# noter/css

This directory contains CSS source files that are processed by our CSS toolchain -
see package.json and Makefile for details. Since we're using Tailwind CSS, you shouldn't
expect to find much in here. See also noter/tailwind.config.js for any customizations.

Processed CSS is located in `noter/http/static`.
